    "This notebook contains the the results for necessity and sufficiency. Necessity and sufficiency are both calculated by either choosing a subset of tokens and perturbing them using the ILM model. The models are all BERT architecture, but trained on different datasets, and for each dataset, a model is trained on both hate/non-hate and abusive/non-abusive labels. The explanations are generated for 120 examples from the HateCheck test suite. These are instances that are explicitly hateful, and are targeted towards women or Muslims. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function ```display_scores``` displays the necessity and sufficiency for each of the examples for all models included. Note that some models will display ```NaN``` for some values. These are the cases where the model mistakenly classified the original instance as non-abusive/non-hateful. In these cases, the current necessity and sufficiency calculations aren't meaningful, because we aim to provide explanations for positive predictions only. The third argument to this function determines which necessity/sufficiency scores to display. "
