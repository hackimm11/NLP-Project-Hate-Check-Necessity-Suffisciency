there are quite a few ideological differences between them. the origin of evolutionary psychology is a bit sketch, sociobiology tries to salvage what's worth saving without the... *baggage*. at least that's my impression, i guess it depends on who you ask.      but yeah studying both would mostly be a matter of methodology rather than human behavior.


quite a few people telling others to kill themselves in that thread, it's only a matter of time for that to happen when trans people are brought up though. so no surprise sadly.

i know menslib is meant to be a gateway, but it still feels kinda . . . iffy to me sometimes. like recently a trans man posted about his anxiety and social disconnection and mentioned he always felt inherent value or something when presenting as a girl and i was like . . . shit you musta been a cute ass girl, cause i never felt that. but i didn't comment cause i felt like i'd get jumped on.

i have scoliosis(a curve to either side in the straight line of my back), lordosis(the curve in the lower s of my back is too big), and kyphosis(the curve in the upper s of my back is too big). so, literally every way your spine can be messed up, it is. it causes me pain every single day. had i gotten a brace it would have been fine. then, my knees are very messed up. long story short, at 13 they had a quack do a surgery on my left knee and he botched it. it pops with every step and is just in general wrong. he's since lost his license to practice because of other cases. because my left knee is messed up, i've compensated with my right for 21 years. now my right is arthritic and i'm only 34. both of these things didn't have to be this way. we had top tier insurance. we had money. but, my mom was an alcoholic and my dad only provided financially. he was never home. my mom made either bad decisions about my health or *no* decisions about it.  by the time i could take care of my own health it was too late. so, i suffer in pain every day, and as i get older it only gets worse, and it didn't have to be this way.      edit: word

i feel like a lot of the issue is that there is a huge disconnect in the three "main" ways that trap is used.  it's used in 1) porn 2) anime/manga 3) towards real people. in the third way it's super offensive, because like you said it's implying trans women aren't real women. in the first two however, it's not always referring to trans women. while i'm sure that there are trans women in "trap" porn, often times they are male identifying who aim for a feminine look. in that case the setting of the porn itself is that they are men trying to "trick" men, so it's an accurate description. finally, when it comes to anime/manga the characters are also male identifying, outside of the (extremely rare) series where characters are transexual, and in those those issues are often addressed.


i fear that violence might be the future of this country for a long while given the divisiveness, vitriol, and the "team sports" nature of politics in this country.

this is an anime term, using it to define a real person is like saying a murderer is a "yandere" because she killed her boyfriends ex... it makes absolutely no sense. 'traps' only exist in anime culture, it's often misinterpreted by people from outside the weebweb because they think it's being used to identify trans folk and, well, that should never be the case.      edit: i'll leave the comment up for context sake but i feel like i'm being misinterpreted here, i go a little more in depth down the chain if anyone is curious. i'm sorry if this poorly written comment offended anyone!

it was gonna happen


the problem is that there's no real way to argue that x is not a reference to y other than just saying it's  unlikely. once someone believes that something is a reference or has a deeper meaning, it's really hard to prove them wrong, even if they don't have any evidence or compelling reason. i'd like to think the burden of proof is on the people trying to prove a connection, but from my experience, it's almost always my burden to try to disprove even the flimsiest connections. "it's a coincidence" isn't really a position that has supporting evidence though.


wow...i'm definitely gonna look that up after i write this. i'm a very strong empath, i feel people truly and completely and i can always tell a person's character by a photo alone. i always sense when something is wrong, and nobody is able to lie to me. when they do it's like..a gentle silent buzzing in my head, and a strange physical prod in my gut. i can tell those who put on happy faces but are truly suffering..and tell the difference between truly troubled teens and those who say things like "i'm so depressed...mum took my phone away. i'm so impressed i hate this family!".       that's how i got the mama nickname. i take on board troubled youths, show them the kindness they deserve and teach them that no matter what, love and friendship are the way forward. one 15 year old in my friend group has adhd, and he can get very aggressive. if we're all playing games and something doesn't go his way, he screams and shouts, tries crashing the server, calls everyone horrible names..and of course the groups all yelling at him..and i've always been the one to calm him. just by treating him like a damn human being. and because i have a true love for police and other emergency services, he now wants to be a good cop and put bad guys away. that makes me a very proud mama ♡    my boyfriend might have high sensitivity.  his intuition saved my life last month.    sorry for the eiffel tower of text lol. i guess when you meet another person who has this blessed but cursed gift, i feel i can talk to them without fear of being judged for being a big soft ball of emo fluff lol. my bf is quite feminine and moves very elegantly. he has marfan syndrome so he's quite lanky xd. he's one of those people where like...just being near him makes everything brighter. he lights up the room and takes pride in his appearance.  he's always getting bullied and yelled at..called a poof, a homo, gayboy etc. it doesn't phase him. he's comfortable being straight and a little bit girly. i just wish i didn't cry if someone so much as giggles at my appearance :(

i'm actually rather shocked the mods deleted that. typically they'l leave up anything they agree with even if it breaks the subs rules. a few weeks ago they left up a direct link to the gofundme of the employee that spit on eric trump despite it being very against sub rules. they only took it down many hours later and only after another article was posted proving that the gofundme was fake and after people there had donated to it.


it was a cluster fuck in terms of funding, i guess. but the plane performs fine and is absolutely superior to anything else out there.      a pretty good lecture on this from an f-18/f-22/f-35 pilot:      > [URL]      he considers the f-35 the "internet" of fighters, as in it has the ability to be upgraded. he considers it a revolution in warfare.

it seems a bit disingenuous to deny that terfs are a major feminist current. germaine greer is still openly admired in many feminist circles, and of all feminist subs, /r/gendercritical is the one that's the most consistently hostile to men. you don't have to like them, but they are feminists.


three kingdoms period is great for historical fiction because of all the great characters it has thanks to the romance. sengoku japan is similar, but lacks a seminal epic covering the era.

reddit routinely shows they have zero idea what a libertarian is.      they think we're anti gay, yet the lp was the first party to support gay marriage...in the 1970s.       they think we're pro mega corp but don't understand that most libertarians believe that mega corps only exist through government intervention (see comcast and drug companies).       they think we're anarchists, we're not. most fall within a classically liberal stance, and some like me are minarchists.      they think we want child slave labor, we don't. that's a violation of the nap.       i don't get why it's so hard to just understand that most of our views are based on voluntary exchange, voluntary consent and not violating the nap.       there's certainly some wakadoodles but no more than any other party and i would argue that there are considerably less crazies than the democrat party.

i think the power jump is equally bad in both series           but the power jump in naruto is so much more jarring to me and i don't know why,like the fights went from "ninjas who rely on technique" to "space wizards who could blow up countries with a sneeze" real quick, and almost every hand to hand fight in the series is way better than the huge explosion chakra fights later         i know that's essentially the same thing with dbz, but it's just that the same problem in naruto bugs me way more

i'm still in therapy for what happened to   me when i was younger, amongst other things...it's so true that only gaining a new perspective on how you feel about trying to deal with the past and move on with life can finally break the bond with past horrors as well as time. i'm glad you're in therapy now and i really hope it helps.


> the statement notes operators have "an average of 20 minutes to consume a meal and get to their next access point to ensure all buses and trains are on time, safe, and ready to serve the riding public."      literally from the article. also from the wording it sounds like she had no choice unless she wanted to hold up transit just to eat lunch after arriving.

not to raise an argument for an all beef diet (why you would choose beef over chicken breast or fish, which are infinitely more healthy is beyond me), but there's at least some merit to a low-carb diet, mostly because it tends to just knock out your appetite making it easier to consume less calories.       i think the big thing about fruit is while it is good for you, it tends to tack on more sugar to the already sugar heavy american diet. if you're woofing down a syrup-laden dole fruit cup after some chicken nuggets and a coke, you're hardly doing yourself any favors.        the cheese and egg thing, they're just really low in carbs according to google. usually low carb diets keep you at like 30-35g of carbs a day, and you'd have to eat over a dozen boiled eggs in day to come close to that. not that you'd want all that cholesterol anyway.

(please ignore the comments where they ask communities to come together and vote. that's not communal. that is secular af.)      thanks guys.      i am literally shaking rn.

this mentality is already starting to backfire. what most people who live in their social media bubbles don't realize is that people in the real world who have actual jobs see right through this bullshit, and the farther they go left, the more they push moderates right.       reddit is in no way, shape or form indicative of the general pop, and when aoc, omar, and their ilk get airtime to broadcast their idiocy, it just makes that idiocy public, and pushes the right to get out and vote much more than they normally would. hell, even nana pelosi realizes this.


i also like it when people break out math.


thank you. i'm bi and i feel the exact same way. the flagrant displays of sexuality and frankly depravity in pride parades make them so cringey. i mean, most of the people at them are just wearing normal clothing and sporting rainbow colors, which is fine. but no one is pushing back against the leather daddies, men in banana hammocks, people wearing leather dog outfits or various other ridiculous fetishism being publicly displayed. it's becoming more and more about fetishes than it is about acceptance of just having a different attraction. someone needs to remind them that you can be a member of the lgbt community and not be in favor of hedonism.

i feel like you misunderstood what i'm saying. it's not about being them being"shallow", it's about them being able to accept that this illness isn't something they have any control over. they can't stop it, they can't correct it, they can only support their partner and accept them as they are. you can genuinely love someone and still leave them for your own mental health. dealing with a partner who's always sick is tough, it wears a person down over time.      plus theres always going to be another girl who doesn't have those problems. the alternative option is always there.       or they could just be alone.      both options would be a lot easier. for a lot of people, those options are better for that reason alone. it beats feeling the helplessness, the never ending frustration that come with loving someone you can't always protect.


did they derive that 98% and 91% as being provable in court, or just ones that were not proven false?      there are two numbers to look at and the number of truthful vs fake accusations is in between.

>and therefore presumably worse situation **for** the insensitive one      everyone perceives the world and life subjectively, that's just how it is, that's how we have to get through life. it can be a good thing and a bad thing, and for people who are sensitive, for one, things might feel bad quicker than for others. but that doesn't mean that the pain they're suffering is less "bad" for them - as you said. because that's how they perceive and feel it, so that's absolute reality for them, even if objectively the issue isn't as bad. they still have to live through it. they have to go through the exact pain someone less sensitive would have to go through because of an objectively worse issue. (most?) people experience life subjectively. the limit to feeling a certain amount of pain for someone sensitive might be lower than for someone less sensitive. but it doesn't mean it's less real, it doesn't mean they're in need of less support and understanding and empathy. it's the same, felt, pain. often, a sensitive person will feel happiness quicker and easier too. does that mean they are, really, less happy than a less sensitive person?       but this was just a rant and i'm sorry if i misunderstood your comment.

> yes, it means incest is not wrong in and of itself, but only as a side-effect of being a power imbalance, and it means relatives who grew up sufficiently apart that they don't have a family power dynamic is morally fine.       sorry, i don't really see where the disconnect is.  this is exactly the point i was trying to make.      i'm saying we think incest is icky because to some extent we are biologically and socially programmed to, but there's really no strong moral argument for it being inherently wrong.

>someone uses their emotional support animal to recover from a traumatic experience   >>"you bitch"         [is that a pet or therapeutic aid?:what should you do if your patients ask you to write letters certifying that their pets are emotional support animals?]([URL]   >emotional support animals make sense, given the large literature on animals' ability to reduce human stress and anxiety and provide other health benefits, says psychologist aubrey h. fine, edd, a professor of education at california state polytechnic institute in pomona and editor of the "handbook on animal-assisted therapy: foundations and guidelines for animal-assisted interventions" (2015)...   >>but psychologists shouldn't write such letters cavalierly, say experts who have examined the issue. because writing such letters could damage the therapeutic relationship, psychologists shouldn't write them for their own patients. and even forensic psychologists should tread carefully.      it's not all fantastic and there are difficulties. universities in particular are almost never set up for animals and they are seeing a large increase of esa requests.       there's also the issue where you can basically just go online and get an order for one, without ever really meeting or seeing the person who writes you a letter. i've seen some sites require a "quick phone call" and some that don't even require that.      considering the benefits, i think esas are an overall great thing. even though there are obstacles or issues that have come up, it's worth tackling them and trying to find solutions rather than abolish the program or hate them out of spite because some people abuse the program like the posters in the op.      we can reduce "esa fraud" if that's what we want to call it, but i think it's worth taking the effort to minimize harm to innocents while closing any loopholes or making changes to the program.       the university situation in particular is interesting. in a lot of dorms things are already cramped and diseases can spread quickly. it's not the healthiest space for humans physically, introducing animals into the situation seems like it could have big repercussions.       for the record i do have an esa and i love them to bits. i've stopped taking two different medications for anxiety and depression and my physical health has reached surprising levels even to my other doctors and specialists.

i'd suggest this video if you have the time, it's made by someone from inside the community that at the same time is trying to not be a bigot.

yeah i think you're right. i asked parkranger about banning and she said something really vague about some people being banned for shady reasons during all the turmoil, and that she was willing to revisit those bans yet she wouldn't confirm who was doing the questionable banning. i don't know if it was her, trailangel, or some other mod. but she did reinstate some people who had been banned. who knows! i think at this point if the mods don't reign in the people who started the drama (who trailangel called the old guard) things will continue to spiral. but i think the old guard folks have too much power and influence with the mods so there is unlikely to be any action taken against the people who are stirring up the drama & so the drama will continue.


that is a legitimate point that i get because i also deal with anxiety. mine has nothing to do with commenting online though so i guess i did not think that could be an issue for some people. thank you.


maybe, last time i did something like this it got banned within 47 minutes of being created. this time i'm trying to be more reasonable and so far it's been okay


i also wanted to add that i legit appreciate your willingness to talk and think, it's not always the case or people devolve into name calling or just fall into bs tactics that try to shut down conversations with shit like "bless your heart".      actual effort means a lot to me especially with random strangers on the internet.

gallowboob gets an insane amount of coverage in a sub completely unrelated to the topic of what he posts. blatant abuse of power.


i've been one of these people. sometimes, you just gotta get these feelings out to someone. even if it's anonymous strangers on the internet, you just gotta get it out. writing it in a journal doesn't work because there's this desperate feeling for someone to know that you're suffering, while also such an intense shame and guilt about it that you can't tell your family or friends. so /r/offmychest gets a post.       at least in my experience, advice or sympathy don't really help and just make me feel worse. i feel the need to argue against it and say "well i've tried that and it didn't work" or shit like that, but feel like such a dick arguing against wellmeaning people that i just don't respond and end up deleting the post a few hours later anyway.       so just don't take it personally. a lot of times folks (or at least me) don't have an outlet and will spew their guts out to the internet because it's better than keeping it in. we aren't looking for advice or sympathy, there's just a depression/anxiety demon whispering in your ear and it often gets so loud that you just need to uncork your feelings to relieve a little pressure. that doesn't mean the effort isn't appreciated.

unsarcastically: the idea of "pride" for oppressed or disadvantaged groups is a celebration of overcoming the oppression and disadvantage. it's a collective pride in having made it this far while putting up with all the shit. it's not the only requirement in order to be proud of yourself or celebrate collective accomplishment, but it can definitely be a legitimate source of pride.      there's not much pride in distinctions of no consequence or ones that are advantages unearned, because there was no hurdle to clear, nothing really achieved. that's why "straight pride" sounds silly or obnoxious, depending on the baggage. this isn't to say "straight shame" is legitimate either, just "straight... is an adjective which applies" is more the right speed.


if you don't consider piracy to be a lost sale then it stands to reason that you'll see pirating a game the same way you'll see boycotting it. that is, just someone not interacting with it at all. it's a poor justification for piracy, but it's not contradictory. boycotts show companies "what a mistake they've made".

unlike peta, steve actually gave a fuck about animals instead of trolling on the internet bitching about the nba using leather basketballs and telling ben and jerry to make their ice cream out of human breast milk.          steve also inspired a ton of dank memes, which is more than we can say about peta.


at least he was better than hideyoshi.

damn, this is some deep shit you got here nibba.

well according to the last census, wh*tes actually represent the unwashed masses in here. i vote arabs as ruling class


yes frens wouldn't have certainly received a bullet at the back of their heads in the third reich.

kurzgesagt , is that you ?


chad move:      "hey, the girl i invited to the date actually does not care at all about the concert, but just wants to spend the night with me. honestly, i think you are right. you should go to the concert instead. the tickets were $40 on pre-sale and are $80 now. i thought about just selling them for $80 each, but since you are my friend i will give you both for only $40 each."      now she either has to admit that she only wants free shit, or that she actually does not really love the artist that much, or... well, buy the tickets.


i just hope that all of twitter can hold hands and hold a charity concert for aids victims in africa one day. hopefully freddie mercury shows up and phil collins appears in 2 places at once.


i have absolutely no idea what is going on. i feel mildly disturbed mostly confused.


i didn't say they weren't different, just that they were both superficial


i've never seen a president try so hard after their presidency to stay relevant in politics like obama. it's like he's back campaigning again.       i remember a year after obama an interview with bush. they asked him how he feels about obama and he just said that he supports him. they asked specifically what he doesn't like about obama and he said "i would find it very disrespectful for a president to talk poorly of his successor"


maybe they love each other very very much!


i watched the contrapoints video on the subject and it was actually super enlightening.


i'm incredibly sensitive and gentle..i'm always getting things like "omg i'm not sugarcoating it to protect you wittle heart. grow up".    so i have to toughen up to be accepted. but i have a quote i thought up that i live by daily. *"there is always a kind way to tell the truth"*    you don't need to sugarcoat anything, but there is *always* a nice way to say things.   i wish people would be more thoughtful and considerate, and those people think i'm pathetic for crying a lot and getting hurt by things.       i feel like i will never be accepted with my autism, depression and anxiety. i'm a gentle soul who tries my hardest to be a good person and care for everyone..but when i'm picked on because i'm easily hurt, i retreat and stay hidden for ages.   i hate feeling like i too have to be a loose tongued, unaccepting bigot to be classed as a person. there's never an excuse to make someone cry..  (in the sense of having no filter for your words). please be kind to others guys. your kindness and care could *literally* save someone's life...


i just read that story, poor dog :(


i don't get it.its cause he's old-timer?


stop wishing for true love, don't look at your dates harshly and cut those that don't fit the 'he's gonna be my husband' feeling.         it is hard to find a man that really seems to want a serious relationship which guarantees marriage, you must know yourself how much harder it is when half the boys don't even give you a chance.          you said that life is fleeting, enjoy every opportunity instead of chasing a prince on a horse, because whatever you might believe of yourself, you can make no good judgement on which unlikely relationship will turn into *that one*. nobody likes incertainty, nobody likes to talk of serious shit when they don't even know the person well, even less so if they don't know the person well and the person is also someone in your case. give every improbable relationship a chance of knowing you and put no pressure on it. no obe wants to hear the stranger they've been dated for 3 weeks is dead-serious about long-term commitment and has more string attached than a corset.            and in case you might start with 'you don't understand'... well, you might not actually understand it either. it is easy to be isolated, refused, frail, and to think you have had all the time in the world to know how things work. it is easy to let the hatred or spite that grows from the feeling of injustice get the better of you. it is also easy to let yourself down. the world is not as naked when you don't have the full picture, even less when you think you had it because of overthinking and over-analysing stuff.          good things will come for you once you let yourself open. but to let yourself open you need not to let yourself down, not to think you understand the world, relationships and partners as well as you might do, and especially, you need to take the risk of losing time and offering yourself a chance with people that might not appear as commited as you wish, even if it is not what you think you want.

why didn't anyone tell me breadtube was this hawt?


does this count as [off my meta] if i'm complaining about stuff on this sub?      based on my own personal experience and other posts i've seen, i would argue there is a real problem with people attacking the op for venting views they do not like. i get this isn't a safe space for any specific groups and i'm not saying people can't disagree with what someone is venting about. i've gotten into it quite a bit with some people's venting here, like them hating an entire group of people because of the actions of a few. however, far too often do i notice people resort to personal attacks, aka ad hominem fallacy. not to mention this violates rule 4 of this sub. i suspect the reason this rule is in place is to stop this sort of thing. attack the argument, not the person.      basically, instead of people addressing why they disagree with what someone is venting about, they often try to discredit the person by making claims like "you're not really x" or "you're fake and a troll". that's not to say trolling doesn't happen here, but often, disagreeing with someone's venting is treated as if that person is just trying to get a rise out of people. it's like people refuse to believe someone could have unpopular opinions and stand by them, no, they *must* be trolling. it's very closed minded too, because the person making the troll claim refuses to think outside of their world view. for example, if you're a racial minority, some people have a hard time believing you if you don't fall into stereotypical views for your race. is it so hard to believe someone can have opinions you don't like and that they believe in them? if they really are trolling, you replying to them just fuels their fire. it's so unproductive to vent if all people are going to do is accuse you of being this or not being that, effectively going against the purpose of this sub.      given that the purpose of this sub is to allow opinions and venting that offmychest wouldn't allow, i would expect better of people here. i dare say if you want a sub like this where people get auto banned from posting in specific subs that offmychest mods don't like, that sub is much more of a fit for you than hanging around here trying to dogpile people who go against your world views.      so, disagree with me on this if you must, but i think it would be better to debunk my arguments rather than claim i'm a fake and thus, that alone is somehow supposed to invalidate everything i've written.

rimworld is such a fun game but damn if it doesn't have some awful people sometimes. i was very pleasantly surprised a while ago when people condemned notch but it was a surprise still.


a real suicidal person wouldn't tell anyone. they'd just do it.      yeah but i'm a wimp and probably wouldn't follow through but i'm still having these unending thoughts every day and it's hard and i want your support.      i made the mistake of telling them this when they were yelling at me about wasting my time and being lazy and getting bad grades and i'm not shitting you my dad told me "well if you're gonna be lazy and just waste space in the world you might as well do it." i'm not even doing that poorly. i have all a's and a b. and the b is in fucking physics for pre med college students, it's hard.       and they actually asked me *why* i'm suicidal. i just fucking am i can't help it it's been like this for 5 years but it's been a lot worse recently. then my dad fucking turns to my mom and asks her why she was suicidal in high school and she says "because my parents didn't love me or care about me and put me in dangerous situations, and i didn't tell anyone i just attempted but failed," and then turns back to me and says "what's your excuse? do you really think we don't love you or something?" like i'm sorry i'm losing the my life is hard competition but i can't just stop feeling like this. and then he finishes up with "you won't actually do it. you're too selfish." honestly fuck my life at this point.       i started crying and told them i just want some support right now and my dad said "you really think we don't give you fucking support" and went on some tangent about how hard his life is because of me and how much he does to support me like no i'm talking about right now this topic i just want you to tell me it's gonna be okay.      all of this was after a like glorious  2 month period of my parents being really nice to me then they hit me with all this shit.      i'm so hurt and starting to think i can't be around them anymore. they're behavior just changes so fucking drastically like this and i don't think i can live with them any longer. i was planning on living at home my freshman year of college (next year) to save money since they offered and we live close to the campus i'm gonna go to but now they're saying they're not sure if they wanna help me anymore and i was told "have fun trying to cover your dorm expenses with your financial aid because we're not gonna help you pay for it." like they're testing if i'll actually leave. i'm fucking confused and trapped. shit fucking sucks man i'm really hurt.       it's not a good day.


haha, if you can't recognize nuance or weigh different factors to come to a conclusion you are literally incapable of reason or logic.       if you are alive, you can enjoy a delicious slice of pizza. therefore by your logic, i have found one reason  to exist, ergo the only possible conclusion is that you should have children.      in reality, the challenges or bad parts of life do not outweigh the good. either way, you have provided no valid or reasonable arguments addressing that.


there's not an insignificant number of people who think there's already equality, and an annoying angry minority who think it's men who are disadvantaged.


man, you think *that's* bad, you should have seen the thread where op picks a girl up for coffee and a drive to the park a bit out of her way, she flirts with someone right in front of him, and he ditches her there.      people were calling him an asshole for not giving her a ride back to her home and for "putting her safety at risk".

what the hell is a bipoc? bisexual person of colour?


is the alternative to just make every born person the same shade of near-black? the in-game assets look different from the ow comics as well. are blizzard artists not aware of how their own characters look or something? this is just such a weak fucking complaint. they're clearly brown. what difference would it make if they were light brown or dark brown?       i'd agree with thos argument if they literally made them white, but the skin tone is still correct. i'm so sorry that artists have different styles. if you're displeased with how a character was drawn by someone, literally nothing is stopping your from drawing it yourself in the way you like it.       like, i don't get why people feel the need to police other people's art. if you want vanta black poc, fucking draw it. if you want it to look like the official work, go play overwatch or read the official comics. one person posting their own pastel-style rendering of the characters doesn't change the fact that the characters have an established model.       overwatch is probably the most diverse game on the market and it literally is never enough for these people. at this point, blizz is almost forced to release a queer black trans person next because it's just about the only thing they haven't done.


it's true. the primary benefactors of these movements are predatory men.              and the trans movement believes in a feminine essence theory, which doesn't jell with many feminists.

killing themselves is the only worthwhile thing a pedo can do with their energy.


she should take the offer.  she can look at it as seed money for the 3 kids she already has, or pay up bills, buy tons of stuff for them, etc. but after she gets it done, she needs to stay away from exes.  i'm not saying that out of judgement btw, i'm saying it as a woman that's been in that exact situation, minus the pregnancy.    


what makes it any different from the taxes you currently pay? denmark has very high taxes so that the government can incentivize people to go to school, provide health care, etc. and it is one of the happiest countries in the world. it still isn't socialism though.

it drives me nuts when people equate issues with lack of access to healthcare (for a small number of the population) to the overall quality of us healthcare. there's a reason why the best doctors from europe flock to the us... hint: it's because they're paid a lot more here

so then life is good? great, we're on the same page. i'm honestly glad you feel that way.      and does knowing that death being the end of life (something good) is completely unavoidable, completely unchangeable, change anything for you?      it can't be escaped, so why spend all of the time you do have free from death thinking about it, fearing it? you don't change anything. you only waste the time you do have on the most meaningless topic.      does knowing the eggs in your fridge will inevitably go bad stop you from baking a cake with them while they're still fresh? no, because cake is delicious and depriving yourself of cake because you know the ingredients have a time limit is nonsensical. similarly, does knowing the eggs will inevitably go bad stop you from putting them in the fridge so you can extend the time in which you can use them? no.      likewise, knowing there is a time limit to your life shouldn't stop you from living it. nor does it make it nonsensical to try to extend it, it's just that at some point you might as well bake the cake, because the end is inevitable.


**you have great walls, too!**

ugh i kinda agree with her. usually when guys say it/how they say it, it comes off as lesser.       should she cry about it? no.


incest never results from a healthy environment/upbringing/mental state. it is a perversion of fundamental norms of familial relationships that almost always indicates something *seriously wrong*. it's not that incest is "inherently" wrong, after all if two well-adjusted adults who happened to be from the same family started banging, that would be fine. the issue is that is almost never how incest arises. even between cousins/siblings, it's *at best* a result of social isolation, codependency, maladjusted social interactions, or shared trauma. this is why incest is so maligned - even when the incest itself isn't abuse, it is a huge indicator of a seriously troubled situation/people. which isn't to say it's always "morally wrong" to *do* so much as it is the outcome of a morally wrong/unhealthy situation. so most people don't bother delving into the details of it and are fine with incest just continuing to be wrong. although you could argue that people engaging in non-abusive incest should be treated more with empathy than demonization.


it is not racist if a group of people gets a positive bonus bc of their skin color.      'xcept it is.

you're an idiot.      >...downvoted just because people don't agree.      yes, that's correct.      why do you think that is? you think you get upvotes because of respect? because you're right?       the voting system is purely democratic. and it changes with the audience. if you put this comment on twitter directly under another person who was upset with beiber, then you'd likely get heaps of likes. unfortunately, they're useless and nobody should really care about them.      >...you have to find every single joke on the planet absolutely hilarious...      who said that? quote me one person in this thread or in the entirety of this comment section who said something along those lines. i seriously want to know.      i don't know anyone who says that. it's basically impossible to find most jokes funny. not everyone can appreciate light humour like piano cat while still enjoying holocaust jokes. but hey, if you can, then you're probably insane.      that being said, if you really hate certain jokes that much, ignore them. anyone who tells speeches or does stand-up knows that the worst feeling you could have after saying something is not a unanimous reaction or a food execution, but just complete silence as everyone transitions to whatever else they were doing.       >i feel like the people who get bent out of shape when someone doesn't agree with them are the ones who are way too sensitive...      yes. again, yes. no one disagrees with you there, especially the aforementioned maniac.      i would go as far as saying most people who get bent out of shape are very sensitive, almost as if that's a defining trait of sensitive people, discounting those that are too shy to voice their opinion, of course.      edit: spelling      tl;dr fuck you read what i said

i think it's a ham fisted attempt at putting environmentalism into a movie where it doesn't make sense.       essentially, it's co-opting art to make a political (in this case environmentalism) message.       i wouldn't say it's the best fit for this sub, but i get where op is coming from.
